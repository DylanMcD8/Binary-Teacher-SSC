# Binary Basics
## Swift Student Challenge 2025 Submission
## By Dylan McDonald

### Description
**Binary Basics** is a simple app that gives you an introduciton to the basics of binary and conversion between binary and decimal numbers. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and I hope that the design feels fun and intuitive! I'll be honest, I got a very late start to this project, so I didn't get to add everything that I wanted to, but I am still happy with the final product. As of right now. I have no plans to make this into a fully-fledged app.

### Specs
- Created with Swift 5 and UIKit
- Developed in Xcode, but compatible with Swift Playground
- Intended experience time: a little under three minutes
